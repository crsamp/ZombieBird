ZOMBIE BIRD:

Overview: Zombie bird is pretty much flappy bird. The object of the game is to go through the pipes and each one you go through, you score goes up by 1. If you hit a pipe or the ground, the bird falls to the ground and the game ends. I am using the libGDX framework to code the game which allows you to code in java then export it to html and ios(if you have an ios computer which i dont).

explanation: My capstone will ustalize many of the concepts we learned throughout the year. One of them being something we just barely touched on while
we were learning about GUI applications, event handling. Ill need to make sure each time the screen is pressed or spacebar is pressed if its on HTML,
the bird goes up. another thing it will use will be good class design. There will be a lot of methods and objects that i will need to be created so good
class design will be essential.

pseudocode/checklist: 
Bird needs to be made.
Bird will need a hitbox.
Bird will stay at the same x coordinate on the screen and will just change y coordinates
Bird will angle downwards and upwards based on falling and flying.
Tubes will be loaded with 40ish pixels between the top and bottom for the bird to pass through. 
The background will scroll, not the bird.
grass and background need to be made.
keep high score(there is a good way to do this to keep the data stored on the phone)(do over summer)

stuff I want to still add when time permits over summer:
power ups and downgrades
high score counter
levels(easy, medium, and hard)




Instructions to run: You will need eclipse. open up all the files (android, core,desktop,html,ios) in eclipse and then go to desktop/src/com/kilobolt/zombiebird/desktop and right click DesktopLauncher.java and select run as and then select java application. (ill post a video of how to do all this).
